Juana Montoya-Murillo.As a current Ph.D. student in Demography at the University of California, Berkeley, my passion for using data to create a more equitable and just society has driven my academic pursuits. I have extensive training in advanced quantitative methods, including coursework in statistics, economics, and demography, which has given me a strong mathematical foundation and the ability to apply different analysis methods to quantitative data using computing tools like R and Python.
